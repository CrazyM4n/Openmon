Openmon
=======

An open-source Pokemon style game. It's in a super early version, like not even far enough to call it a game yet. Don't worry though! It is being coded by one single developer with a passion for games. This is coded completely in Python 3.3 using PyGame, a powerful SDL Python port.

NOTE: Just in case it is any issue, I am using ripped textures from Pokemon Diamond FOR NOW, as I am horrid at spriting and would make the game look horrible. If there are legal problems with that, I will try to sprite the game myself, though it might not go very well. Just remember that I am making this game for no other reason than to have fun.

Feel free to fork or help this project at your own will!
