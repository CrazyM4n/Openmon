Openmon
=======

An open-source Pokemon style game. It's in a super early version, like not even far enough to call it a game yet. Don't worry though! It is being coded by one single developer with a passion for games. This is coded completely in Python 3.3 using PyGame, a powerful SDL Python port.

Feel free to fork or help this project at your own will!
